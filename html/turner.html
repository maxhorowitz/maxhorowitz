            <h1>Estimating & Procurement</h1>
            <p>This department at Turner Construction is responsible for budgeting massive-scale construction projects, obtaining subcontractors, and supplying the resources needed for the building process to run smoothly. This process includes bidding between subcontractors and subsequent leveling between subcontractors' offers, which is the act of choosing between subcontractors to find the best fit, value, and quality for the job. As of their 2019 annual report, Turner Construction earned $13.2 billion and was titled the largest domestic contractor.</p>
            <h1>Job Description</h1>
            <p>As an Estimating & Procurement Intern, I was tasked with collecting and organizing subcontractors' needed documents into larger packages so that Turner management could sign off on each subcontractor. Once all subcontactors' contacts within a project were finalized and their documents were signed, the construction could begin. For each package I collected and organized a series of contracts, approval letters, insurances, and financial statements. During this process I got acute insight into the financial side of construction and how large scale projects are planned.
            </p>
            <h1>OSHA Certification</h1>
            <p>During this internship Turner helped me obtain my OSHA 30 Certification. OSHA stands for Occupational Safety & Health Administration, and their goal is to ensure safe guidelines and procedures are followed during construction. It has become a standard in the United States for all construction professionals to take this course. In fact, most construction and labor insurance companies will not accept applications unless all employees have been certified by OSHA.
