            <h1><b>WISE Project</b></h1>
            <p>In the spring of 12th Grade, I engaged in a WISE Individualized Senior Experience project. My goal for the two month venture was to construct a functional computer-numerically-controlled abrasive waterjet cutter. This machine is kept in the STEAM department at The Leffell School.</p>
            <h1><b>What is a CNC Waterjet Cutter?</b></h1>
            <p>A CNC machine interprets ".gcode" and "Computer-Aided-Design" files that are produced on a computer in either 2D or 3D. These design files can be used by compatible machines to either carve an object out of a larger mass or build an object from scratch in a process known as 3D printing.</p>
            <p>An abrasive waterjet cutter is a device that propels water and abrasive (sand) at very high speeds toward materials in order to cut or carve those materials.</p>
            <p>So, in conjunction with one another, a CNC abrasive waterjet cutter is a device that utilizes high pressured abrasive water to cut through various materials intricately, with the goal of producing precise designs and pieces out of 2D materials.</p>
            <h1><b>How it Works</b></h1>
            <div class="floatL"><img src="../images/WCH.JPG"></div>
            <p>A modified electric pressure washer motor propels water at a constant flow rate and a constant pressure of 2900 PSI. Then, using various high pressure tubing and fittings, the water source is connected to an A2 Abrasive Waterjet Cutting Head. This part can be found at accustream.com. The A2 Abrasive Waterjet Cutting Head evenly mixes abrasive into the water stream and focuses the stream to be 0.03" diameter. This stream then has the power to cut through plastics, wood, and even steel. This waterjet cutter is coupled with a <a href="https://www.v1engineering.com/assembly/">Mostly Printed CNC</a>, which provides precise movements according to ".gcode" file instructions. In tandem, the waterjet cutting assembly and the Mostly Printed CNC produce exact 2D designs out of a variety of material boards, whether soft like plastic or dense like metal.</p>
            <h1><b>Testing</b></h1>
            <div class="floatR"><img src="../images/WJC-MAX.jpg"></div>
            <p>As a means of testing the machine's accuracy in producing designs, I designed a cutout of my name, uploaded the design to the machine, and placed a cardboard square on the cut-bed. I then fastened a sharpie onto the end of the waterjet cutting head, and I turned off power to the pressure washer motor so that no water would come out. Instead of cutting my name out of the cardboard, I was hoping for the machine to draw my name on it. Here is the result. This test demonstrates that the machine's CNC functionality is near perfect, as it very accurately completed its design.</p>
